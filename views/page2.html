            <b> Three brothers appeared before her,</b> and announced to her
            that they were desirous of trying their luck. The eldest believed he
            would be quite safe if he crept into a lime-pit, but she saw him
            from the first window, made him come out, and had his head cut off.
            The second crept into the cellar of the palace, but she perceived
            him also from the first window, and his fate was sealed. His head
            was placed on the nine and ninetieth post. Then the youngest came to
            her and entreated her to give him a day for consideration, and also
            to be so gracious as to overlook it if she should happen to discover
            him twice, but if he failed the third time, he would look on his
            life as over. As he was so handsome, and begged so earnestly, she
            said, yes, I will grant you that, but you will not succeed.
