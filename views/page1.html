            <b> There was once upon a time a princess,</b> who, high under the
            battlements in her castle, had an apartment with twelve windows,
            which looked out in every possible direction, and when she climbed
            up to it and looked around her, she could inspect her whole kingdom.
            When she looked out of the first, her sight was more keen than that
            of any other human being, from the second she could see still
            better, from the third more distinctly still, and so it went on,
            until the twelfth, from which she saw everything above the earth and
            under the earth, and nothing at all could be kept secret from her.
            Moreover, as she was haughty, and would be subject to no one, but
            wished to keep the dominion for herself alone, she caused it to be
            proclaimed that no one should ever be her husband who could not
            conceal himself from her so effectively, that it should be quite
            impossible for her to find him. He who tried this, however, and was
            discovered by her, was to have his head struck off, and stuck on a
            post. Ninety-seven posts with the heads of dead men were already
            standing before the castle, and no one had come forward for a long
            time. The princess was delighted, and thought to herself, now I
            shall be free as long as I live.
