            <b> The youth went straight to the palace.</b> The princess was
            already expecting him, and abandoned herself to her fate. The
            wedding was solemnized, and now he was king, and lord of all the
            kingdom. He never told her where he had concealed himself for the
            third time, and who had helped him, so she believed that he had done
            everything by his own skill, and she had a great respect for him,
            for she thought to herself, he is able to do more than I.
