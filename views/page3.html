            <b> Next day</b> he meditated for a long time how he should hide
            himself, but all in vain. Then he seized his gun and went out
            hunting. He saw a raven, took a good aim at him, and was just going
            to fire, when the bird cried, don't shoot, I will reward you. He put
            his gun down, went on, and came to a lake where he surprised a large
            fish which had come up from the depths below to the surface of the
            water. When he had aimed at it, the fish cried, don't shoot, and I
            will reward you. He allowed it to dive down again, went onwards, and
            met a fox which was lame. He fired and missed it, and the fox cried,
            you had much better come here and draw the thorn out of my foot for
            me. He did this, but when he wanted to kill the fox and skin it, the
            fox said, stop, and I will reward you. The youth let him go, and
            then as it was evening, returned home.
