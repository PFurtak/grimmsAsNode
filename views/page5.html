            <b> Next day</b> he went to the lake, called the fish to him and
            said, I suffered you to live, now tell me where to hide myself so
            that the king's daughter may not see me. The fish thought for a
            while, and at last cried, I have it, I will shut you up in my
            stomach. He swallowed him, and went down to the bottom of the lake.
            The king's daughter looked through her windows, and even from the
            eleventh did not see him, and was alarmed, but at length from the
            twelfth she saw him. She ordered the fish to be caught and killed,
            and then the youth appeared. It is easy to imagine the state of mind
            he was in. She said, twice you are forgiven, but be sure that your
            head will be set on the hundredth post.
